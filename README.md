This code repository focuses on writing reliable and maintainable test cases. The methodology explained in this codebase may not be the only way to achieve desirable results. This approach has consistently worked in my previous projects and hence thought of sharing it with wider audience.

### This code sample tries to cover following aspects of Unit Testing
* Configuring mocks and verifying their interactions
* Static Mock
* Nested test cased to group behaviours together
* Assertions for Exception
